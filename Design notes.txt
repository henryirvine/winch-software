* Winch control software design considerations
** Winch control/sensor functions
   Battery state (temperature/capacity)

   Cooling oil
   - pump control
   - Temperature (motor outlet or possibly delta T across motor)
   - pressure 

   Load Pins

   Sheave Hall effect
   - rope speed
   - odometer

   Dog Clutch 
   - Position
   - Operation

   Air Pressure (required to fire guillotine)

   Aux Motors - These inverter controllers can probably be connected to the CANbus directly 

   Main motor - Definitely via CANbus
   - motor torque
   - motor speed
   - temperature?
   - send torque commands

   Guillotine 

** States
*** Standby
    This is the state that is active after the winch is powered on.
    Sensors are recording, odometers initialize.
    Cooling pump/fans are active 
    No drum motion should be occurring -- Alert if a drum is moving
    Main and aux drum motors are disabled.
    Warning lights are off
    Enable ready/standby button.
    Ready/Standby button transitions to Ready State

*** Ready
    Warning lights are on
    If drum motion is detected place that drum into retrieve mode.
    
    Drum Selection is available
    - Drum must not be moving.
    - Rope must be out.
    - Air pressure checked 
      
    Selecting a drum causes a transition to Prepare state.
    Ready/standby button transitions to standby
    Abort button transitions to standby
    
    
**** Retrieve -- sub-mode of Ready
     Entered when drum motion is detected on a drum that is not selected for launch.
     Announce on control panel.
     Monitor drum speed and activate drag motor once speed is over retrieve threshold.
     Deactivate drag motor once drum speed is below threshold.
    
*** Prepare
    This state is entered when a drum is selected.
    Condition lever activates aux motor for taking up slack.
    Pre-arm checks
    - Motor/Cooling 
    - Battery State
    - Launch Parameters
      
    Disable Ready/Standby button.
    When pre-arm checks are satisfied, enable the Arm button
    When enabled arm button is pressed, transition to Armed state
    
    If abort button is pressed, de-select drum and transition to standby.

*** Armed
    In this state, all prerequisites for starting the launch have been met.
    Cooling pump and fans -> high speed
    Charging system -> high rate

    When condition lever is advanced to 100% detente:
    - If using WR control, enable the WR controller
      - When WR Launch-Initiate transition to Roll-Rotate
    - If not using WR control, Transition to Roll-Rotate
    
    If abort button is pressed, de-select drum and transition to standby.
    
*** Roll-Rotate
    Launch Begins.
    Soft power-up to roll tension limit (~glider+pilot weight)
    Maintain tension until speed limit reached then reduce as needed to maintain speed.
     
    After decreased tension is sensed, increasing tension transitions to climb state
    Abort button transitions to abort state
    Condition lever to zero transitions to recovery state
    Cooling failure transitions to recovery state
    Sensor failure transitions to recovery state
    Release detection? Low tension x time?
    
*** Climb
    Winch is in tension control mode, speed is controlled by pilot/climb angle
    Disable WR control if it is being used.
    Condition Lever to zero transitions to Recovery state
    Cooling failure transitions to recovery state
    Sensor failure transitions to recovery state
    Abort button transitions to Abort state
    Release detection transitions to recovery state

**** Ramp-up
**** Constant Tension
**** Ramp-down
    
*** Recovery
    Condition lever adjusts winch speed. 
    Active stop engaged when odometer reaches close limit or abort button pressed
    Deselect drum once stopped.
    Transition to ready once deselect completes
    
*** Abort
    Fire guillotine on the selected drum
    disable aux motors
    Active stop drum motion on selected drum using regen braking.
    when drum stopped, de-select drum
    when de-select complete, transition to Standby state.

** Control panel
*** Condition lever
    Function varies based on state.
    Range 0-100% detente 100%-130%

*** Abort button
    Does something sensible in any state except standby.

*** Arm 
    Flashes when enabled, Steady when armed

*** State lights
    where are we in the state diagram.

*** Warning lights 
    drum motion
    hi temp
    lo batt
    oil press
    
*** Ready lights
    Launch parameters
    
*** Display window/LCD
